## Summary

This is the repo where 
* I collect fun projects/ideas/playgrounds 😆, or
* I experiment with stuff  🤔😮😱, or
* Projects so small which do not worth another repo, or
* DO HORRIBLE THINGS 😱😱😱, like rewriting ~~Git's~~ history


## Interesting Parts
* [bin/add-prefix-to-commits](blob/master/bin/add-prefix-to-commits) A Bash
  script which **REWRITES** Git's commit message history w/ `git filter-branch`
  😱😱😱 (**SUPER DARK MAGIC**)
* [bin/push-subtrees](/blob/master/bin/push-subtrees) A Ruby script which pushes all
  sub folders to GitHub as branches w/ `git subtree`
* [branch/django-rest-take-2](/tree/2016-05---Py-Django-Rest---django-rest-take-2)
  Having fun with Django and Django REST framework (check out commits with
  Emojis 😆 🙌 ❗️❗️❗️ )

## WHY T?

My last name starts with `T` and it's the most common name I use for
something/anything I don't know how to name properly, yet.

> SHOW ME THE CODE

Be careful of what you wish for. 😈

```python
# t.py
class T:
  def t(t1):
    return t1
```

```swift
// t.swift
protocol T1 {
    func t1(t1:String)
}

protocol T2: T1 {
    func t2()
}

struct TTT: T2 {
    func t1(t1:String) { }
    func t2() { }
}

// Swift 2.2
TTT().t2()              # ✅ compiles nicely
(TTT() as T1).t2()      # ❌ compiler error
```

```ruby
class T
  def t
    "t"
  end
end
```

<br>
**TBC**
```ruby
etc.
```
