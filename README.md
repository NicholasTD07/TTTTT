## Summary

This is the repo where 
* I collect fun projects/ideas/playgrounds 😆, or
* I experiment with stuff  🤔😮😱, or
* Projects so small which do not worth another repo, or
* DO HORRIBLE THINGS 😱😱😱, like rewriting ~~Git's~~ history

## TODOs

- Swift Bits
- Python Bits
  - SwiftInitGen: Auto-generate public init method for Swift structs/classes
  - SoulPool: Simulate my ideas about the existence of soul with BDD 😈

## Interesting Parts
* [bin/add-prefix-to-commits](/bin/add-prefix-to-commits) A Bash
  script which **REWRITES** Git's commit message history w/ `git filter-branch`
  😱😱😱 (**SUPER DARK MAGIC**)
* [notes/git-filter-branch-over-a-range-of-commits.md](/notes/git-filter-branch-over-a-range-of-commits.md) Rewrite Git History Over a Range of Commits 😱😱😱😱😱😱
* [bin/push-subtrees](/bin/push-subtrees) A Ruby script which pushes all
  sub folders to GitHub as branches w/ `git subtree`
* [branch/django-rest-take-2](../..//tree/2016-05---Py-Django-Rest---django-rest-take-2)
  Having fun with Django and Django REST framework (check out commits with
  Emojis 😆 🙌 ❗️❗️❗️ )
* [swift-experiments](./swift-experiments)
  I need to write a weekly blog about what I learned with these experiments.
  I learnt so much and I WANT TO SHARE THEM!

## About Me

An iOS developer seriously passinate about programming in general, mainly coding in the following languages:

* Swift
* Python
* Ruby
* Tiny little bit of Bash

You can ~~worship 🙌 me~~ ping me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/NicholasTD07). 😆 `(JK abt 🙌)`

## WHY T?

My last name starts with `T` and it's the most common character I use for naming
something/anything I don't know how to name properly, yet.

> SHOW ME THE CODE

Be careful of what you wish for. 😈

```python
# t.py
class T:
  def t(t1):
    return t1
```

```swift
// t.swift
protocol T1 {
    func t1(t1:String)
}

protocol T2: T1 {
    func t2()
}

struct TTT: T2 {
    func t1(t1:String) { }
    func t2() { }
}

// Swift 2.2
TTT().t2()              # ✅ compiles nicely
(TTT() as T1).t2()      # ❌ compiler error
```

```ruby
# t.rb
class T
  def t
    "t"
  end
end
```

<br>
**TBC**
```ruby
etc.
```
