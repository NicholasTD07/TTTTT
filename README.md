# TTTTT

That's right, five Ts.

<br>

This is the repo where 
* I collect fun projects/ideas/playgrounds or
* I experiment with stuff or
* Projects so small which do not worth another repo

## WHAT?

My last name starts with `T` and it's the most common name I use for
something/anything I don't know how to name properly, yet.

> SHOW ME THE CODE

```python
# t.py
class T:
  def t(t1):
    return t1
```

```swift
// t.swift
protocol T1 {
    func t1(t1:String)
}

protocol T2: T1 {
    func t2()
}

struct TTT: T2 {
    func t1(t1:String) { }
    func t2() { }
}

TTT().t2() # ✅
(TTT() as T1).t2() # ❌ compiler error
```
